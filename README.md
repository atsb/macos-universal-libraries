# macos-universal-libraries
A collection of universal frameworks and libraries for macOS Intel and ARM64

These are all ready for use.  The only change I made was to devIL to get it building with modern libraries.  The source is included.

This is so folks don't have to install macports just for a few libraries, especially devIL which is currently broken on macports.
